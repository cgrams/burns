List of Burns

Sit down or take a nap. But cut the crap while getting schooled on how to rap.
I go to the gym until I'm fully swoll while you go to the buffet until you're fullyvfull
I'm the teacher that can't be beat. You're the student that can't find his seat!
I'm the the teacher that can rock. You're a student that I can mock. Because I have more friends than you have followers on TickTock.
I spit rhymes like the rap gods. You need to turn up the volume on your fake AirPods. Everyone, look at him. See how he nods.
You need a lenz to see me driven a benz in my T-ens!
I get paid for my lemonade while you sit in the shade I made and fade.
Through sheer force of will I'm a hip-hop master: you effort is at nill so your a learning disaster
From here to Flynn's beach I teach what is just out of your reach
I don’t mean to boast, I don’t mean to brag but you’re the stupidest student when you wag.
Listen to this attack. Because it's a fact. That what's in my mind you lack, and if you drop out you'll be back.
Expect more like a centaur cuz i'll be your mentor
- I’m the leader of the new school, you shall not pass, until the bell rings to let you off of class.

- This classroom is my dungeon so I hope you’re prepared. My raps are wildfires that will have you running scared.

- I spit fire bars that could melt the sun just for fun, but you’ve got as much heat as a water gun

- My wizardry with words is a masterpiece from the heavens, you’re out of luck but I keep hitting triple sevens. 

- I’m cooler than an Eskimo, more drip than a tap. You can act like it’s not facts, but I know you’re all cap.
