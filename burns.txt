List of Burns

Sit down or take a nap. But cut the crap while getting schooled on how to rap.
I go to the gym until I'm fully swoll while you go to the buffet until you're fullyvfull
I'm the teacher that can't be beat. You're the student that can't find his seat!
I'm the the teacher that can rock. You're a student that I can mock. Because I have more friends than you have followers on TickTock.
I spit rhymes like the rap gods. You need to turn up the volume on your fake AirPods. Everyone, look at him. See how he nods.
You need a lenz to see me driven a benz in my T-ens!
I get paid for my lemonade while you sit in the shade I made and fade.
Through sheer force of will I'm a hip-hop master: you effort is at nill so your a learning disaster
From here to Flynn's beach I teach what is just out of your reach
I don’t mean to boast, I don’t mean to brag but you’re the stupidest student when you wag.
Listen to this attack. Because it's a fact. That, If you drop out you'll be back.
Expect more like a centaur cuz i'll be your mentor
